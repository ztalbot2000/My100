This will be an incomplete change log until further notice.

v1.0Alpha-5 (Work in progress)
===========
- Will try to update CAD drawings and create a video of what is operational.

v1.0Alpha-4
===========
Note: The electronics will continue from Alpha-3. I actually have gantry
moving.!!!
There are some design changes I want to make that may only be refeclected
in the build much later. Specifically orientating the X-Axis so that the Hot
End faces backwards. This will potentially allow multiple Hot Ends to handle
multiple colors.

- Updated wiring clamps and created a endstop wiring clamp.
- Created a Gotcha document. If you build any 3D printer on your own, this
  would have been nice to know first.
- Need to create documentation on how to compile Marlin for components used.
- Steppers are operational.
- Had fun trying to figure out RATOS, Pronterface, OctoPi. Klipper and Marlin
  trying to get steppers tested. Most tools think you must have the printer
  fully assembled before it will move a stepper.
- Add drawio schematic. Duplicated some images, I should resolve this later.
- Add in Wiring clamps, guides, grommets.
  HDMI and USBC connectors to go out the back (Elbows required).
- Add X Stop to rear left RodStabilizer. Not in main assembly yet.
- Change BeltFasteners to have more space for MidRail fasteners.
- Instead of large bed, create build plate lifters to each Z Axis rod.
  Not in main assembly yet.
- Add Z Stop to rear left RodStabilizer if Clicky not used. Not in main assembly yet.
- Reduce weight of Carrier.
- Mount X-Axis linear rail on its own printed bar so that the X-Axis is
  more rigid.
- Added endstops to bottom of Left Gantry block and left rear rod stabilizer.
  This is wrong and is being fixed as homing is back right.
- Added ball joint models for build plate to use short bed supports.
- This will all be merged as Alpha-4 but my actual build as many features yet
  not implemented in CAD.



v1.0Alpha-3 (Built, except Lower Rails re-used from Alpha 2)
===========
- Back Mid rail was rotated upside down so the steppers face upwards allowing
  their cables to be more easily routed and to shift center of mass lower.
- Modified belt fasteners to go around mid side rail mounting screws.
- Corrected bed parts to reflect their correct position relative to their
  part names.
- Changed bed center from solid to a shell, reducing material required to
  print it.
- Changed bed center overlap from filet to peg/hole connections to make it
  easier to assemble.
- Change RodStabilizer and Bed/Build Plate fastening holes to be M3 Heat
  insert diameter.
- Proof equations so that all parts that ribbon touch align exacly which was
  required after turning Mid Back rail upside down so steppers face upwards.
- Change four fastening holes to three to better accomodate screw heads.
- Add chamfer to fastening holes for screw heads on verticals.
- Add 24V DC to 5V DC converter onto enclosure bottom.
- Change to 1 foot mount hole on each side of vertical rail.
- Add fastening screws to frame.
- Move MidBackRail X&Y steppers forward to allow space for rear stepper screws.
- Add chamfer to corner of belt tensioners so they fit inside verticals.
- Add counter sink to gantry block mounting holes
- Increase size of Gantry block access holes.
- Add third Gantry block clamp hole for future X-Axis Linear Rail support.
- Add cable holes to lower frame


v1.0Alpha-2 (Altered from Alpha-1 build)
===========
- Change to three screws in each frame connection to avoid screw collisions.
- Increase diameter of BeltTensioner mounting hole.
- Add lower enclosure for mouting electronics.
- Remove lower corner gussets as no longer needed.
- Remove upper corner gussets as no longer needed.
- Add lower enclosure to mount electronics.
- Add mounting holes for PSU, Pi4 and Octopus V1,1 to lower enclosure.
- Change MidRail width from 1.25in to 2in for strength and allow
  for stronger Z-Axis rod stabilizers.
- Beef up Z-Axis rod stabilizers for future increase of Z-Axis length.
- Split assemblies so there is a MidFrame (Gantry) assembly.
- Create NC file for lower enclosure
- Add missing folder AcquiredParts
- Add PSU to assembly
- Add Pi4 to assembly
- Add OctopusV1.1 to assembly. Note: Step file is broken. Used a picture
  that mated to the enclosure instead of its standoffs.


v1.0Alpha-1
===========
This was actually built! Here are the things I would/did improve on
- I put 4 screw holes in each frame connection to the upper and lower
  rails. Three should be used as the inner most screws collide.
- The mid rail was made out of flat aluminum.  It bends to easily and
  should be made out of steel or 90 degree aluminum.
- The NC files are correct.  I did alter the feeds and Z-axis starting
  position and depths during the runs.
- During assembly, the rail corners needed to be filed to account for
  the 90 degree inside bead of the vertical supports.
- I used a 1/2 inch drill bit set to the appropriate depth on my drill
  press to make a chamfer that accommodates the head of a flat head machine
  screw.

v1.0Alpha-0 (Untagged)
======================
- The 3d printed base should not contain a 90 contour to mount the inner
  square as it causes the slicer to build a shelf to support it during
  printing.  This was changed to a 45 degree angle.
