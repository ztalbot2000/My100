&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of pictures that will be posted here as the My100 becomes a reality.  As this is Alpha quality, buyer beware.

## The Metal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All but the mid rear rail has been cut to size here.

## The Bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bed was printed. This turned out to be costly and if I were to change this, I would CNC it instead; But don't the colors look pretty :-)

## The Gantry Blocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gantry Blocks were printed. This is in accordance with the100. Printing it reduces the weight which increases how fast the gantry blocks can be moved.

## The Belt Tensioners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Belt Tensioners were printed.  It was easier to replicate the100 belt tensioners. Like the My100 Gantry, steal 5mm shafts were used and idler pulleys to decrease the noise I heard from just using M5 bolts..

## The First Metal Frame CNC Photos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frame is designed so that the drill holes can be made with a drill press as previously mentioned; However, since I have a large CNC that I built years ago, the following are the first images of the front side of the Front Left Vertical support being CNC'd.
