This will be an incomplete change log until further notice.

v1.0Alpha-3 (Work in progress)
===========
- Back Mid rail was rotated upside down so the steppers face upwards allowing
  their cables to be more easily routed and to shift center of mass lower.
- Modified belt fasteners to go around mid side rail mounting screws.
- Corrected bed parts to reflect their correct position relative to their
  part names.
- Changed bed center from solid to a shell, reducing material required to
  print it.
- Changed bed center overlap from filet to peg/hole connections to make it
  easier to assemble.
- Change RodStabilizer and Bed/Build Plate fastening holes to be M3 Heat
  insert diameter.
- Proof equations so that all parts that ribbon touch align exacly which was
  required after turning Mid Back rail upside down so steppers face upwards.
- Change four fastening holes to three to better accomodate screw heads.
- Add chamfer to fastening holes for screw heads on verticals.
- Add 24V DC to 5V DC converter onto enclosure bottom.
- Change to 1 foot mount hole on each side of vertical rail.
- Add fastening screws to frame.
- Move MidBackRail X&Y steppers forward to allow space for rear stepper screws.
- Add chamfer to corner of belt tensioners so they fit inside verticals.
- Add counter sink to gantry block mounting holes

Note: Actual build needs to catch up to most of these SolidWorks assembly
      changes.

v1.0Alpha-2 (Altered from Alpha-1 build)
===========
- Change to three screws in each frame connection to avoid screw collisions.
- Increase diameter of BeltTensioner mounting hole.
- Add lower enclosure for mouting electronics.
- Remove lower corner gussets as no longer needed.
- Remove upper corner gussets as no longer needed.
- Add lower enclosure to mount electronics.
- Add mounting holes for PSU, Pi4 and Octopus V1,1 to lower enclosure.
- Change MidRail width from 1.25in to 2in for strength and allow
  for stronger Z-Axis rod stabilizers.
- Beef up Z-Axis rod stabilizers for future increase of Z-Axis length.
- Split assemblies so there is a MidFrame (Gantry) assembly.
- Create NC file for lower enclosure
- Add missing folder AcquiredParts
- Add PSU to assembly
- Add Pi4 to assembly
- Add OctopusV1.1 to assembly. Note: Step file is broken. Used a picture
  that mated to the enclosure instead of its standoffs.


v1.0Alpha-1
===========
This was actually built! Here are the things I would/did improve on
- I put 4 screw holes in each frame connection to the upper and lower
  rails. Three should be used as the inner most screws collide.
- The mid rail was made out of flat aluminum.  It bends to easily and
  should be made out of steel or 90 degree aluminum.
- The NC files are correct.  I did alter the feeds and Z-axis starting
  position and depths during the runs.
- During assembly, the rail corners needed to be filed to account for
  the 90 degree inside bead of the vertical supports.
- I used a 1/2 inch drill bit set to the appropriate depth on my drill
  press to make a chamfer that accommodates the head of a flat head machine
  screw.

v1.0Alpha-0 (Untagged)
======================
- The 3d printed base should not contain a 90 contour to mount the inner
  square as it causes the slicer to build a shelf to support it during
  printing.  This was changed to a 45 degree angle.
