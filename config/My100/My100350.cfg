#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
speed: 50
# speed: 120 # As per video 
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
horizontal_move_z: 10  # See printer.cfg why we put this to 10.
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
# mesh_min: 20,20
# mesh_min: 30,30 # As per video
mesh_min: 30,0 # From z_tilt. Move out of range 30, -45
mesh_min: 30,40 # From z_tilt. Move out of range 30, -5
mesh_min: 30,45 # From z_tilt.
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
# mesh_max:265,260
# mesh_max:315,260 # As per video
mesh_max:320,285 # From z_tilt
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
# probe_count: 7,7
probe_count: 3,3 # Creates 9 points
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
fade_end: 10.0
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
mesh_pps: 2,2
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
algorithm: bicubic
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
bicubic_tension: .2
