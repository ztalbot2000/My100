# Techniques for Precise Aluminum Cutting and Drilling Using a Mitre Saw and a Drill Press.

<BR><BR>
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When designing the My100 I realize a lot of people do not have a CNC with a two foot bed. That is not to say that you cannot still produce a precise build with just a Mitre Saw and a Drill press so long as you follow some basic principles.

### Principles of 2.5 and 3.5 times material thickness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all of the fastenning holes for the My100 are offsets of 2.5 and 3.5 times the material thickness. This allows precision between mating pieces to be achieved easily by being able to have two shims of the 1/8th inch material thickness and a 1/8th in drill bit to create a 2.5 times 1/8th inch centered pilot hole from the edge of the material or 3.5 times 1/8th inch centered pilot hole from the side of the material.

### End Stops For Equal Lengths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you measure, mark and cut more than 1 piece, you are gauranteed to introduce error. If you have just a mitre saw, use end stops to cut all the width, length and vertical pieces at the same time, gauranteeing their equal sizes.

### Drilling Opposing Holes At The Same Time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using a drill press, drill all the pieces corresponding holes from the front to the back, left to right and bottom to top or at least in such a manner that the mating hole on the opposite piece is drilled at the same time from the same end. Using this method, at least any error introduced will not cause any issues.
