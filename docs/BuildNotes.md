A silicone heater mat is a great way to heat your 3D Printer build plate. Please make sure you select the right size of mat for your 3D printer.

All silicone heater mats include 3M 468MP 200MP adhesive backing so you can easily adhere the heater mat to the build plate. This adhesive is rated for temperatures up to 149C long term and 204C short term.
Silicone heater mat includes NTC 100k beta 3950 thermistor (use “Generic 3950” in config)
All our silicone heater mats are 110v AC
It is recommended to use High Temp RTV silicone around the edge of the silicone heater mat after installing on the build plate as a safety measure during installation. This will ensure the heater mat never falls off the build plate.
Red wires are for thermistor
White wires are power wires for the heater element
