&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of pictures that will be posted here as the My100 becomes a reality.  As this is Alpha quality, buyer beware.

## The Bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bed was printed. This turned out to be costly and if I were to change this, I would CNC it instead; But don't the colors look pretty :-)

## The Gantry Blocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gantry Blocks were printed. This is in accordance with the100. Printing it reduces the weight which increases how fast the gantry blocks can be moved.

## The Belt Tensioners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Belt Tensioners were printed.  It was easier to replicate the100 belt tensioners. Like the My100 Gantry, steal 5mm shafts were used and idler pulleys to decrease the noise I heard from just using M5 bolts..
