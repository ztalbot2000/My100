This will be an incomplete change log until further notice.




v1.0Alpha-1
===========
This was actually built! Here are the things I would/did improve on
- I put 4 screw holes in each frame connection to the upper and lower
  rails. Three should be used as the inner most screws collide.
- The mid rail was made out of flat aluminum.  It bends to easily and
  should be made out of steel or 90 degree aluminum.
- The NC files are correct.  I did alter the feeds and Z-axis starting
  position and depths during the runs.
- During assembly, the rail corners needed to be filed to account for
  the 90 degree inside bead of the vertical supports.
- I used a 1/2 inch drill bit set to the appropriate depth on my drill
  press to make a chamfer that accommodates the head of a flat head machine
  screw.

v1.0Alpha-0 (Untagged)
======================
- The 3d printed base should not contain a 90 contour to mount the inner
  square as it causes the slicer to build a shelf to support it during
  printing.  This was changed to a 45 degree angle.
